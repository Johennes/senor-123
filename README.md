# Señor 1.2.3

Señor 1.2.3 is a browser clone and a free adaption of the [original Professor 1.2.3] by Texas Instruments. I owned one when I was a kid and spent countless hours on it back in the day. Unfortunately, my original device is defunct so I made this browser copy for my own kids to play it, too.

Not all of the original features were implemented and some of the features that are present did not exist on the device. I may add more functionality to this based on feedback from my kids and other people. In general, it's not meant to be an exact copy but rather an adaption with similar features and a nostalgic touch.
